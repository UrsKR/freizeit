"Freizeit" ('Spare Time') is a simple Grails app, helping you to request leave and print the request as a PDF.

I created the application during my alloted time for side projects at [IDOS AE GmbH](www.idos.de).

#### Installation ####
1. Install [Grails](www.grails.org) 1.3.7
2. Run ``grails war``
3. Install the resulting .war in your servlet container.
